**Theorem**: Whisk(e)y is the finest spirit ever distilled! 

**Proof**: The proof is trivial and left as an exercise to the reader QED.

## About 

***Proof*** is a whisk(e)y collection management system. It provides a place to keep track of whisk(e)ys purchased, tried, or seen, and to document your experiences. The name is a play on the word "proof", which in the context of spirits, is a measurement of alcohol content. In mathematics (my area of interest/study), a proof is a collection of logical arguments that result in the demonstation of the truth in a claim. This tool aims to show the irrefutable truth about whisk(e)y; that, with the right information in hand and the right guidance, everyone can find a wee dram to enjoy.
